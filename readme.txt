How to build:
1. Set up IntelliJ IDEA Plugin SDK in project settings
2. You may need to manually add some libs (like junit) to IntelliJ IDEA Plugin SDK from IntelliJ IDEA folders.
    They are not added automatically for some reason.
3. Check out fresh IntelliJ IDEA sources: http://www.jetbrains.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=983225
    and attach them to IntelliJ IDEA Plugin SDK to be able to view and debug IDEA code.
3. Right-click on intellijcoder-idea module, select option "Prepare Plugin Module intellijcoder-idea for Deployment"
